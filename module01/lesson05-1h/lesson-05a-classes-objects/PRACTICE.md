# Practice — Lesson 05A

## Required Task: Book Class

### Requirements
Create a `Book` class with:
- Fields:
  - `Title` (string)
  - `Author` (string)
  - `Pages` (int)
- Method:
  - `PrintSummary()` prints a one-line summary of the book

In `Main`:
- Create **two Book objects**
- Assign values to their fields
- Call `PrintSummary()` on each

### Expected output (example)
Your output format can vary, but it should include title, author, and pages.

## Optional (Early Finisher): Movie Class
Create a `Movie` class with:
- `Title` (string)
- `Rating` (string)
- `DurationMinutes` (int)
- `PrintDetails()` method

Instantiate one `Movie` object and print its details.

## Success Checklist
- [ ] I used `new` to create objects.
- [ ] I used descriptive variable names (no `b1`, `s`, etc.).
- [ ] My methods are called on objects using dot notation.
