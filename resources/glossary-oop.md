# OOP Glossary (Student Reference)

- **Class**: A blueprint that defines data (fields/properties) and behavior (methods).
- **Object**: An instance created from a class using `new`.
- **Field**: A variable inside a class that stores data (usually `private`).
- **Property**: A class member that controls access to data (can validate values).
- **Constructor**: Special method that runs when an object is created to initialize state.
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting object state by controlling how data is read/changed.
